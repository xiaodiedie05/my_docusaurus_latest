## TWR 2019: Developing Technical Documentation

In developing technical documentation course, I learned about the docs-as-code process and writing in Markdown language. I learned the Markdown syntax and created a microsite while saving my progress in GitHub. With the git commands, I was able to create and save all markdown files that I have created.
This course allowed me to learn about the markdown language and use software that allows me to test my knowledge and see the result instantly just like the current assignment.
